# Gsap Nature Site

This repo contains the initial markup for a Vue 3 + Gsap tutorial.

To get started, clone the repo and cd into the correct folder.
Then, run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. Finally, open up `localhost:3000`.

The full code (including animations) is available in the `with-animations` branch if you get stuck along the way 👍
